          The internet functions as a web. It is made up of servers, 
          which host files written in HTML for internet browsers to interpret.
          When someone wants to go to a website their computer sends an HTTP request to a server, 
          which then sends back the appropriate HTML document for their web browser to interpret.

          Hypertext Markup Language documents contain text content which is the buidling blocks for what the web page will look like when viewed through a browser.
          To write in HTML one uses a series of different tags that surround elements which tell the browser how to display the content.
          Some of these elements can be described as inlnineor block elements. When writing code it is important to remember that computers are stupid.
          Meaning that they are extremely literal and can't make simple corrections that a human could. 
          For example, a small typo could ruin an entire section of code because the computer will only read it exactly how it is written.

             Tags can have class attributes with assigned values.

            Exploring the Relationship Between CSS, HTML, & DOM

            <p>
              By using HTML div tags, we create a cascading, collapsable flow of instructions/information. A neat, indented, and consistent strucutre is very important when working in HTML.
              <br><br>
              It is obvious why once you begin to add style using CSS. It is inheritance which makes CSS so effective at eliminating repitition.
              <br><br>
              Inheritance is the effect in which editing an ancestral element of the tree-like structure can then apply to everything that is enclosed under that element.
              <br><br>
              Descendant elements inherit text-related properties, but box-related properties are not inherited. Inheritance prevents the programmer from having to enter the same style values over and over again in-line. Repitition is the enemy!
